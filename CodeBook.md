This dataset contains records for 30 subjects. Using built-in tools of a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II), they were monitored across 6 different activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).

The original dataset and more details on the methodology can be found at this website:

A number of metrics were recorded (561 in total). The file final_summarized_results.txt  contains the following: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

* The mean of all variables  *x* from the original dataset, where all *x* variables are means or standard deviations of some other variable. The variables being averaged are as follows:

These means are grouped by subject and activity. So: for every activity that the subject performed, there will be averages across all 86 variables.
